OVERVIEW

Add/Remove Plus! is a better alternative to Control Panel's Add/Remove
Programs list, designed to help you manage the list with programs that
can be uninstalled by Windows. Instead of uninstalling a program using
the standard Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs dialog box, uninstall
it with Add/Remove Plus! After removing the program from your computer,
Add/Remove Plus! will ensure that the program is also removed from the
Add/Remove list.

Add/Remove Plus! also allows you to manage the Add/Remove list. Orphan
entries (applications that are missing the uninstall program) are
marked with a special icon, and you can easily remove them. You can
also modify the existing entries or add new entries to the list (you
may even drag shortcuts to uninstall programs and drop them over
Add/Remove Plus! to add them to the list).
